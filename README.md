# P4-Packet-Monitoring
The goal of this is to use the capability of P4 devices to monitor and track flows, and collect corresponding statistics. 
 
 Monitoring devices such as Netflow collect active IP network traffic as it flowsi n or out of an interface. While Netflow and other legacy protocols provide visibility and help 
 identifying network problems, they are not granular (resolution is typically in order of seconds) and are subject to proprietary implementations.
 
 Use P4 and collect the following statistics. 
 Source and Destination IP addresses
 Source and Destination transport-layer ports
 Amount of unidirectional traffic (bytes)
 Start Time
 End Time
 Rate (bits per second)
